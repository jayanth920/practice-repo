### 3. Install the `gh-pages` npm package

1. Install the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) npm package and designate it as a [development dependency](https://nodejs.dev/learn/npm-dependencies-and-devdependencies):
 
    ```shell
    $ npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

At this point, the `gh-pages` npm package is installed on your computer and the React app's dependence upon it is documented in the React app's `package.json` file.

### 4. Add a `homepage` property to the `package.json` file

1. Open the `package.json` file in a text editor.
   
    ```shell
    $ vi package.json
    ```

    > In this tutorial, the text editor I'll be using is [vi](https://www.vim.org/). You can use any text editor you want; for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Add a `homepage` property in this format\*: `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`

    > \* For a [project site](https://pages.github.com/#project-site), that's the format. For a [user site](https://pages.github.com/#user-site), the format is: `https://{username}.github.io`. You can read more about the `homepage` property in the ["GitHub Pages" section](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) of the `create-react-app` documentation.

    ```diff
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "0.1.0",
    + "homepage": "https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages",
      "private": true,
    ```
At this point, the React app's `package.json` file includes a property named `homepage`.

### 5. Add deployment scripts to the `package.json` file

1. Open the `package.json` file in a text editor (if it isn't already open in one).
   
    ```shell
    $ vi package.json
    ```

2. Add a `predeploy` property and a `deploy` property to the `scripts` object:

    ```diff
    "scripts": {
    +   "predeploy": "npm run build",
    +   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build",
    ```

At this point, the  React app's `package.json` file includes deployment scripts.

### 6. Add a "remote" that points to the GitHub repository

1. Add a "[remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote)" to the local Git repository.

    You can do that by issuing a command in this format: 
    
    ```shell
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/{username}/{repo-name}.git
    ```
    
    To customize that command for your situation, replace `{username}` with your GitHub username and replace `{repo-name}` with the name of the GitHub repository you created in Step 1.

    In my case, I'll run:

    ```shell
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages.git
    ```

    > That command tells Git where I want it to push things whenever I—or the `gh-pages` npm package acting on my behalf—issue the `$ git push` command from within this local Git repository.

At this point, the local repository has a "remote" whose URL points to the GitHub repository you created in Step 1.

### 7. Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages

1. Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages

    ```shell
    $ npm run deploy
    ```

    > That will cause the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json` to run.
    >
    > Under the hood, the `predeploy` script will build a distributable version of the React app and store it in a folder named `build`. Then, the `deploy` script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.

    > By default, the new commit on the `gh-pages` branch will have a commit message of "Updates". You can [specify a custom commit message](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/issues/80#issuecomment-1042449820) via the `-m` option, like this:
    > ```shell
    > $ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
    > ```

    GitHub Pages will automatically detect that a new commit has been added to the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository. Once it detects that, it will begin serving the files that make up that commit — in this case, the distributable version of the React app — to anyone that visits the `homepage` URL you specified in Step 4.

**That's it!** The React app has been deployed to GitHub Pages! :rocket:
    
At this point, the React app is accessible to anyone who visits the `homepage` URL you specified in Step 4. For example, the React app I deployed is accessible at https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages.

### 8. (Optional) Store the React app's _source code_ on GitHub

In the previous step, the `gh-pages` npm package pushed the distributable version of the React app to a branch named `gh-pages` in the GitHub repository. However, the _source code_ of the React app is not yet stored on GitHub.

In this step, I'll show you how you can store the source code of the React app on GitHub.

1. Commit the changes you made while you were following this tutorial, to the `master` branch of the local Git repository; then, push that branch up to the `master` branch of the GitHub repository.

    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Configure React app for deployment to GitHub Pages"
    $ git push origin master
    ```

    > I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. It will have two branches: `master` and `gh-pages`. The `master` branch will contain the React app's source code, while the `gh-pages` branch will contain the distributable version of the React app.
