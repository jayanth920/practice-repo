### DEPLYING A REACT APP
### 1. Install the `gh-pages` npm package

1. Type this in the terminal to install github pages , make sure your in your react app folder containing app.js,index.js,package.json etc.
 
    ```terminal
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

At this point, the `gh-pages` npm package is installed on your computer and the React app's dependence upon it is documented in the React app's `package.json` file.

### 2. Add a `homepage` property to the `package.json` file

1. Open the `package.json` file in a text editor.
   
    ```shell
     code . package.json
    ```

    > You can use any text editor you want; for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Add a `homepage` property in this format\*: `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`

    > \* For a [project site](https://pages.github.com/#project-site), that's the format. For a [user site](https://pages.github.com/#user-site), the format is: `https://{username}.github.io`. You can read more about the `homepage` property in the ["GitHub Pages" section](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) of the `create-react-app` documentation.

    ```diff
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "0.1.0",
    + "homepage": "https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages",
      "private": true,
    ```
At this point, the React app's `package.json` file includes a property named `homepage`.

### 5. Add deployment scripts to the `package.json` file

1. Open the `package.json` file in a text editor (if it isn't already open in one).
   
    ```shell
     code . package.json
    ```

2. Add a `predeploy` property and a `deploy` property to the `scripts` object:

    ```diff
    "scripts": {
    +   "predeploy": "npm run build",
    +   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build",
    ```

At this point, the  React app's `package.json` file includes deployment scripts.


### 3. Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages

1. Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages , thru terminal.

    ```shell
     npm run deploy
    ```

    > That will cause the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json` to run.
    >
    > Under the hood, the `predeploy` script will build a distributable version of the React app and store it in a folder named `build`. Then, the `deploy` script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.

    > By default, the new commit on the `gh-pages` branch will have a commit message of "Updates". You can [specify a custom commit message](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/issues/80#issuecomment-1042449820) via the `-m` option, like this:
    > ```shell
    > $ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
    > ```

    GitHub Pages will automatically detect that a new commit has been added to the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository. Once it detects that, it will begin serving the files that make up that commit — in this case, the distributable version of the React app — to anyone that visits the `homepage` URL you specified in Step 4.

**That's it!** The React app has been deployed to GitHub Pages! :rocket:
    
At this point, the React app is accessible to anyone who visits the `homepage` URL you specified in Step 4. For example, the React app I deployed is accessible at https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages.

### 5. NOW DO THIS !

    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Configure React app for deployment to GitHub Pages or anything u want"
    $ git push origin master
    ```
    if git push origin master doesnt work , do only 'git push' , instead. Wait for 30 seconds , ur website must be deployed.

    > I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. It will have two branches: `master` and `gh-pages`. The `master` branch will contain the React app's source code, while the `gh-pages` branch will contain the distributable version of the React app.
